The server is designed to listen for connections on socket 20202 until it receives a call from a client. When a connection is received from player 1, the server listens for incoming connections until it receives a connection from player 2. When both players are connected to the server, a function responsible for handling connections between them is started, which creates threads for each player. The thread responsible for handling the socket receives data from the player and sends it to the other client, until the client terminates the program or an error occurs in receiving or sending the message.
